# simple gym workout page
if you managed to make it to this github repo, congrats! theres nothing important to be seen here. it isnt meant to be public, but it isnt really private and it doesnt use any backend so it doesnt deserve a dedicated server, github pages is more than enough

this is mostly optimised for mobile devices (we dont bring our PCs to the gym, sorry for inconviniences)

had to do this cuz we used to store our routines in a google docs document (goofy ahh)


updates expected, but here's a screenshot:
